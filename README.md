The Weather App is a simple Java application that provides users with current weather information based on their location input. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Swing, allowing users to easily interact with the application.

Features
1. Weather Data Retrieval: The application fetches weather data from the Open Meteo API based on the user's input location. It retrieves information such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and windspeed.
2. Search Functionality: Users can enter their desired location in a text field and click the search button to retrieve weather data for that location.
3. Dynamic Weather Visualization: The GUI dynamically displays weather conditions using appropriate weather icons and textual descriptions. It updates the displayed information based on the fetched weather data.
4. Interactive User Interface: The GUI provides a user-friendly interface with text fields, buttons, and labels for easy interaction. Users can input their location, initiate searches, and view weather information effortlessly.
5. Error Handling: The application includes error handling mechanisms to manage cases such as invalid input locations or failed API connections. Error messages are displayed to inform users about issues and guide them through resolving them.
6. Backend Logic: The backend logic handles communication with the Open Meteo API, parsing JSON responses, and processing weather data. It ensures accurate retrieval and presentation of weather information to the user.
